## Welcome to my page!

I'm Juri Opitz, an NLP (Natural Language Processing) researcher currently based in Heidelberg, Germany.

### Interests

#### PhD topic: Meaning representations and similarity explainability

Given a text, how can we capture *who does what to whom?* Meaning representation try to express the answer to this questions in a structured format, such as a graph, which can be processed and understood by machines.

My PhD topic is the analysis, design and application of *metrics* between such representations. While such metrics are important to check the quality of systems that generate meaning representations, an interesting potential of such metrics is that they can *explain* to us why (and in which aspects) two texts are similar, or dissimilar. 

#### Classification Evaluation

Even though classification is a task that is straightforward, the suitability of a metric for testing the performance of a classifier can differ from case to case. In the courses that I taught and in my own research, questions that have popped up repeatedly are

- should we use this metric or that?
- why do researchers compare annotators with metric a, but systems with metric b?
- what does it mean, when a data set is "imbalanced", how should this affect the selection of an evaluation metric?

#### Computational humanities

Finally, I a passion of mine is the analysis of historic data. In particular, I find it very interesting to test the large-scale statistical analysis of patterns in collections of historic texts, exploring the European medieval ages across time and spatial axes.

For instance, we have automatically reconstructed coordinates and movement patterns for thousands of medieval entities, starting from the time of the Carolingian dynasty (~750 CE) to Maximilian I. (~ 1500 CE). 

All code for the experiments and the data is available at my github.
